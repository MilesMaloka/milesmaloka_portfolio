# My Magazine-Style Portfolio

Welcome to my creative portfolio! This project is designed as a sleek, magazine-inspired website to showcase my design and development work in a bold, stylish format.

## About Me

I'm a passionate designer and aspiring front-end developer who thrives on crafting digital experiences that feel artistic, modern, and engaging. With a background in Computer Science and a growing interest in design, I strive to blend functionality with aesthetics in every project I work on.

## Inspiration

This portfolio was born out of my love for visually driven content. I’ve always admired the storytelling power of magazines—their clean layouts, striking imagery, and focus on both beauty and message. I wanted to create a portfolio that felt like flipping through a high-end magazine, with sections that guide the viewer through my story, my projects, and my style.

My inspiration also came from wanting to stand out from traditional portfolios. Instead of a static page or simple layout, I wanted to craft something immersive—where visuals, typography, and interactivity all play a role.
